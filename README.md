For creating a Personal Budget Tracker, here are the following requirements:

**User Authentication**

- Users should be able to create an account, log in, and log out
- Password encryption is necessary for security

**User must be able to manage expenses**

- Be able to add, delete, and edit expenses
- Each expense includes date purchased, source, category, amount, and description

**User must be able to manage income**

- Be able to add, delete, and edit income sources
- Each income includes date, source, amount, and description

**Budget Summary**

- Main dashboard that shows income, expenses, and remaning budget after calculation
- Have a tab that sees highest contributing expenses and income sources

**Overview by time**

- Users can click a button in main dashboard such that it displays a graph showing their income/expense trends
- Allow users to filter by date range, and different data.

**Desktop for now**

- Ensure the application works on desktop, and mobile. But I'm lazy, so let's start with desktop for now.
